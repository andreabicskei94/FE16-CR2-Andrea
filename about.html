        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. Food Recipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who
            labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening shuffling dishes in and out of the
            oven.

        </p>

        <p class="text">Most importantly, Food Recipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community vibrant. Sixty-million
            home cooks deserve no less.</p>
        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p class="text">

            Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com,Food Recipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Food Recipes has become the world's largest community-driven
            food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month. Every day, cooks from around the world publish recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The combination of the
            Food Recipes community with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels. You can connect with us
            and our 11M followers on social media, too. On TikTok, learn how much salt to add to your pasta water or find out if air fryer custard toast lives up to the hype. On Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter, browse easy weeknight meals and scour reviews
            of the world's best air fryers. Find photo-worth dinner inspiration on Instagram. And on YouTube, cook along with Chef John, who serves up creative, new recipes weekly — alongside a few good laughs and a well-timed pun. In 2020, Food Recipes
            launched our first podcast, Homemade which you can find on all major audio platforms. Our hosts interview chefs, cookbook authors and home cooks who share their stories, food memories, and favorite moments in the kitchen. If you own an Amazon
            Alexa or Google Assistant device, you'll find our recipes easily discoverable via Voice search. Apple and Android users can access their saved recipes and search using the Dinner Spinner app.
